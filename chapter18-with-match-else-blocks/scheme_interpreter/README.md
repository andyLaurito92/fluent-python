This folder contains my study of the scheme interpreter implemented first by Peter Norvig and later adapted by Luciano Ramalho.

Some useful resources:

- Original source can be found in Norvig's webpage [here](https://norvig.com/lispy.html)
- Adapted code by Luciano can be found [here](https://github.com/fluentpython/example-code-2e/tree/master/18-with-match/lispy/py3.10/)

Once you have studied the aboves, continue with this [other implementation](http://norvig.com/lispy2.html) by Peter. It contains some 
improvements on the original interpreter
